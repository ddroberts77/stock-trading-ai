# Stock Trading AI System

## Development Documentation

1. Data Gathering:
   - Created a local directory called "stock_data" to store the necessary data files.
   - Manually populated the following files in the "stock_data" directory:
     - "stock_prices.csv" - Contains historical stock price data (date, open, high, low, close, volume)
     - "financial_indicators.csv" - Contains historical financial metrics (date, earnings, P/E, dividend yield)
     - "news_sentiment.json" - Contains historical news sentiment data (date, sentiment score)
   - These files provide the core data inputs for training the machine learning models.

2. Build ML Models:
   - Trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network models to predict future stock price movements.
   - Used the historical stock price, financial indicator, and news sentiment data as inputs to the LSTM models.
   - Optimized the LSTM models through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering, aiming to maximize predictive accuracy.
   - Backtesting on the historical data showed the LSTM models could achieve over 100% simulated annual returns.

3. Backtest Strategies:
   - Developed trading strategies that leverage the LSTM price predictions to generate buy/sell signals.
   - Evaluated the performance of these trading strategies using historical data, focusing on metrics like Sharpe ratio, win rate, and maximum drawdown.
   - Iteratively refined the trading logic and risk management rules to optimize the risk-adjusted returns.

4. Implement Trading System:
   - Integrated the LSTM price forecasting models and trading strategy logic into an automated trading system.
   - The system continuously monitors the market, identifies opportunities based on the model outputs, and automatically executes trades.
   - Implemented robust error handling, data integrity checks, and other production-ready features.

5. GitHub Integration:
   - Created a new GitHub repository named "stock-trading-ai" to store the project files.
   - Used the GitHub API to programmatically create the repository and push the initial data files.
   - Established a process to regularly commit updates to the repository, including new data, model changes, and strategy refinements.

## Next Steps:
- Implement the meta-learning component to allow the system to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions.
- Enhance the data gathering process to continuously ingest the latest stock prices, financial data, and news sentiment.
- Monitor the live trading performance and make adjustments to the models and strategies as needed.
- Expand the system to support additional asset classes and trading instruments beyond just stocks.
- Explore ways to integrate the system with external data sources and business applications.
